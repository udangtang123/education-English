What really make this Academy different is the great attention given to students, they analyse carefully the strength and weakness of their student, they work on clear strategy to improve students performance and are very flexible to change strategy when needed. they worked patiently with my son and improved his performance to excellency. It is great how management and especially Mr. Victor follow up with us on my son progress , I received many phone calls and emails with updates,  this tight follow up and advices we received resulted in huge difference in my son performance and his awareness to his education. I highly recommend QEA.",

During the initial change  of school due to Covid my son was going to a public ally funded school and the most contact he had with his teachers was to read or watch something on-line and then do an assignment which he got a grade back but no feedback on what he did right or wrong. At Queensway academy my son has to sign on daily with his teacher and classmates ( small class size only 8 students)  and she actually teaches a class.  There is plenty of time for questions and my son gets feedback on his tests. Being at work I can’t monitor if my son actually signs on but there is great communication from the school. One day my son slept in and I got text and emails asking where my son was.  They follow up quickly if you have any questions or concerns.  I highly recommend attending here.  Great learning happens here.",

She is registered for physics 12 in the fall.  Due to the pandemic situation we have been very worried that our child is not going to get the foundations in math and science that she needs. Thanks to Victor and his team of highly qualified teachers our concerns have been alleviated.  Megan has had the traditional in class model with QEA and has just finished up with an online platform.  Both have been great and I am confident that Megan is now prepared for university.  I truly believe that the public school system of distance learning cannot do what Victor and his team have done for my daughter.  She has been prepared for success as a direct result of professional teaching methods that work.",

Private credit courses were mainly grade 12 English over the summer and grade 12 math courses throughout the fall semester in the evening. I have heard quite a bit about private credit courses offered by other schools that are not as through and almost too easy for students to get high average. Courses at QEA are well laid out and very extensive to make sure they provide good foundations for post secondary education.    Victor is excellent at communicating with parents and students and he is also very good at listening and acting on everyones feedback. Highly recommend QEA!!",

                            these important skill and never learn them fully in school. They are often given essays and
                            assignments and struggle on their own. How do you write a good thesis? How do you pick a good
                            quote on your body paragraph and build arguments around it? At QE, we have tutors specialized

                      Kids usually write the way they text. There is no structure. Often times they are blanked out when
                      they are asked to write a paragraph or topic. Writing is a process, that kids need to learn how to
                      brainstorm, organize their thoughts and write their ideas on paper, in a coherent and effective way.
                      In our elementary English tutoring in Calgary, we teach effective writing that serves as a foundation

                                    <p>Many students underestimate the importance of critical analysis and that 20-30% of the marks (application / thinking) are allotted to this section.  As a result, many students struggle through this part or worse, ignoring it, which will end up showing in their poor grades.  The common mistake student make in critical thinking, is summarizing the plot.  Students are expected to perform deep analysis on the text.  The key to critical thinking is asking "why".  And from there you will be able to derive the significance of the plot, the character, etc, and begin your analysis. Our English tutoring Calgary provide comprehensive lessons on critical thinking.  It takes time to master this, as this is a key foundation skill for high school English.  It is important to get help early with QE English tutoring Calgary.</p>

It also includes the comprehension component of oral communication, that is to say the ability of students to understand and comprehend spoken English. These are extremely important and valuable skills that come in handy in day-to-day life.</p>
                    <p>Reading and Literature Studies: This segment of the curriculum evaluates a student’s ability to read English literature and to comprehend and analyze it. Shakespeare will be taught in this segment, as well as poetry and short stories. The goal is to leave with a capacity to read independently, critically, and with keen understanding of the text, as well as to be in contact with works of genuine cultural and literary importance.</p>
                    <p>Writing: the goal of this segment is to produce confident and effective writers who can organize their thoughts clearly, while producing strong and grammatically correct sentences. Beyond that the course will also focus on various forms of writing including the essay, which is central to higher level coursework in English and other disciplines. Students will be exposed to a variety of forms of writing, and given the opportunity to develop strong writing skills.</p>
                    <p>Media Studies: This segment focuses on analyzing and interpreting media texts, including graphics, sounds, and images. The influence of mass media and popular culture is explored and discussed critically. Students are given the tools to make sure they can be aware of the messages floating around mass media and online culture in an academic and critical capacity, as well as the capability to create their own contributions to that culture.</p>

              <p style="font-weight: 400;">English 12 is difficult because of the volume of work and how demanding
                English teachers are. Students tend to misunderstand key components in
                their essay. As a result, they lose marks on critical thinking which often
                covers 20-30% of his work. For example, instead of analyze the Shakespeare
                text in the essay, the students will resort to plot summary, and lose marks
                on critical thinking</p>

              <p style="font-weight: 400;">
                English 11 is a senior high school course, in that teachers have higher expectation and demand
                on the level of literary analysis and essay. Students often times have difficulty on expressing their
                point of view in a clear and concise manner. One common error is to use big, complex vocab,
                trying to impress the teacher, but without considering the context and usage. Often times it is more
                effective to use clean, concise wording and arguments, while establishing a strong flow that is easy
                for the reader to understand.

            <div class="pt-course-intro__text">
              <p>English is the most crucial subject in high school because all university admissions require an excellent English grade. Achieving excellence in English in high school and primary school needs a wide range of skills, including reading comprehension (the capacity to extract crucial information efficiently), essay writing (the ability to convey the student's opinions effectively), and critical analysis (the ability to delve beneath the story to analyze characters, themes, and passages).</p>
              <p>The QEA English tutoring program produces three essential skills: reading, writing, and critical analysis. The aim is to develop three skills sets with our English students by working through their English curriculum in school. In teaching English essay writing, for example, we educate our students on how to develop essay beginnings that can grab the audience's attention, how to construct a concise and strong thesis, and how to build arguments around the quotations from their Shakespeare plays or novels.</p>

                  <p>Students nowadays are accustomed to writing short messages on their phones.&nbsp; The problem is that these messages have no proper grammatical structure, which becomes a habit and a reflection of their poor English writing.&nbsp; QEA first disciplines the students into using proper English structure and grammar, and then helps them to develop their writing skills in a step by step approach that involves brainstorming, outlining, and revising.</p>

                <div class="pt-course-info-group__content">
                  <p>Often in high school English essays, students only state the plot of the story and neglect the in-depth analysis, which always leads to mark deduction. The student needs to go deep beyond the story; they need to tie their argument to a character or theme.&nbsp; This portion accounts for a large portion of marks as students progress into senior English courses.</p>

                  <p>Reading comprehension is a critical part of English.  Through reading, students are expected to grasp the key information quickly.  This is an important skill to develop in English.  One key strategy is to ask a series of questions beforehand, such as: “What is the author trying to convey in this chapter?”  When doing this, the student should have a plan in mind before reading, which will improve the effectiveness of their reading comprehension.</p>

                        <p>If you aren’t performing well in the subject, chances are you have foundation gaps.  The first step is really to address your foundation gaps.  Typically this is about essay writing and critical thinking.  For students in junior high school, it could be sentence structures and grammar (such as run on sentences).  Our English tutors in Calgary do provide lessons on essay writing and if needed, on sentence structures.  It is important to learn the basics and build a strong foundation, as you will need your English skills throughout high school (all other subjects and projects) and universities.  You need to avoid the mentality of “getting by”, and focus on mastering these skills for long term.</p>

                        <p>The second advise we give, is to put your 100% effort into this.  It means that reading ahead on your Shakespeare or novels, or spend time analyzing the text.  Our English tutors in Calgary will provide you with guidance, and for English your hard work will pay off.</p>

When you read, you should ask yourself questions to get you thinking critically about why something happened, why a character acted the way they did, and how all of this relates to the story's subject.</p>

What really make this Academy different is the great attention given to students, they analyse carefully the strength and weakness of their student, they work on clear strategy to improve students performance and are very flexible to change strategy when needed. <span class="wp-more">they worked patiently with my son and improved his performance to excellency. It is great how management and especially Mr. Victor follow up with us on my son progress , I received many phone calls and emails with updates,  this tight follow up and advices we received resulted in huge difference in my son performance and his awareness to his education. I highly recommend QEA.</span><span class="wp-more-toggle">read more</span></div>

                      <div class="p-review-card__text">At a time when school had to be done differently, Queen Elizabeth Academy stepped up to the plate.  During the initial change  of school due to Covid my son was going to a public ally funded school and the most contact he had with his teachers was to read or watch something on-line and then do an assignment which he got a grade back but no feedback on what he did right or wrong. <span class="wp-more">At Queensway academy my son has to sign on daily with his teacher and classmates ( small class size only 8 students)  and she actually teaches a class.  There is plenty of time for questions and my son gets feedback on his tests. Being at work I can’t monitor if my son actually signs on but there is great communication from the school. One day my son slept in and I got text and emails asking where my son was.  They follow up quickly if you have any questions or concerns.  I highly recommend attending here.  Great learning happens here.</span><span class="wp-more-toggle">read more</span></div>

She is registered for physics 12 in the fall.  Due to the pandemic situation we have been very worried that our child is not going to get the foundations in math and science that she needs. <span class="wp-more">Thanks to Victor and his team of highly qualified teachers our concerns have been alleviated.  Megan has had the traditional in class model with QEA and has just finished up with an online platform.  Both have been great and I am confident that Megan is now prepared for university.  I truly believe that the public school system of distance learning cannot do what Victor and his team have done for my daughter.

Private credit courses were mainly grade 12 English over the summer and grade 12 math courses throughout the <span class="wp-more">fall semester in the evening. I have heard quite a bit about private credit courses offered by other schools that are not as through and almost too easy for students to get high average. Courses at QEA are well laid out and very extensive to make sure they provide good foundations for post secondary education.   <br>Victor is excellent at communicating with parents and students and he is also very good at listening and acting on everyones feedback. Highly recommend QEA!!</span><span class="wp-more-toggle">read more</span></div>

What really make this Academy different is the great attention given to students, they analyse carefully the strength and weakness of their student, they work on clear strategy to improve students performance and are very flexible to change strategy when needed. <span class="wp-more">they worked patiently with my son and improved his performance to excellency. It is great how management and especially Mr. Victor follow up with us on my son progress , I received many phone calls and emails with updates,  this tight follow up and advices we received resulted in huge difference in my son performance and his awareness to his education. I highly recommend QEA.</span><span class="wp-more-toggle">read more</span></span></div>

                                <span class="wp-google-text">At a time when school had to be done differently, Queen Elizabeth Academy stepped up to the plate.  During the initial change  of school due to Covid my son was going to a public ally funded school and the most contact he had with his teachers was to read or watch something on-line and then do an assignment which he got a grade back but no feedback on what he did right or wrong. <span class="wp-more">At Queensway academy my son has to sign on daily with his teacher and classmates ( small class size only 8 students)  and she actually teaches a class.  There is plenty of time for questions and my son gets feedback on his tests. Being at work I can’t monitor if my son actually signs on but there is great communication from the school. One day my son slept in and I got text and emails asking where my son was.  They follow up quickly if you have any questions or concerns.  I highly recommend attending here.  Great learning happens here.</span><span class="wp-more-toggle">read more</span></span></div>

Due to the pandemic situation we have been very worried that our child is not going to get the foundations in math and science that she needs. <span class="wp-more">Thanks to Victor and his team of highly qualified teachers our concerns have been alleviated.  Megan has had the traditional in class model with QEA and has just finished up with an online platform.  Both have been great and I am confident that Megan is now prepared for university.  I truly believe that the public school system of distance learning cannot do what Victor and his team have done for my daughter.

Private credit courses were mainly grade 12 English over the summer and grade 12 math courses throughout the <span class="wp-more">fall semester in the evening. I have heard quite a bit about private credit courses offered by other schools that are not as through and almost too easy for students to get high average. Courses at QEA are well laid out and very extensive to make sure they provide good foundations for post secondary education.   <br>Victor is excellent at communicating with parents and students and he is also very good at listening and acting on everyones feedback. Highly recommend QEA!!</span><span class="wp-more-toggle">read more</span></span></div>

We'd heard great things about Victor and the Queen Elizabeth Academy from friends who had <span class="wp-more">kids take fast track classes.  The low student to teacher ratio and the extra 1:1 care they provide really helps bring out the engagement compared to a 33 student class.  My son has greatly enjoyed the course--though summer classes are intense and fast paced.  All the more reason for extra attention during instruction.  We would recommend Victor and his team of instructors for any of the accredited high school programs they are offering.</span><span class="wp-more-toggle">read more</span></span></div>

We found the teacher in her high school did not <span class="wp-more">care, nor take time to ensure they understood. Tests covered content that was not taught in class. Her experience was a disaster! Given this we put put her back to QE  to upgrade her mark too prepareand ensure she had background for university.  Not only have we seen a 15-20% bump in mark but we have seen her confidence soar because the teacher teaches the content, ensures they understand and truly cares during covid- yes online has been fantastic! Money well spent and calc.will be with QE since public education in math is failing miserably. Big shout to QE and their fantastic teachers!</span><span class="wp-more-toggle">read more</span></span></div>

Thank you all<br/><br/>Marija<br><br>Update on July 25.<br><br>This summer we were very hesitant about online lessons since we had bad experience with our regular high school distance learning. Victor reassured us that this won’t be the case with his school. I have to admit quality of learning is outstanding teachers are very passionate and caring. They make sure that each kid in the class understand the unit. The classes are so well organized online and they flow smoothly. We are very glad we signed up for the summer school wit QEA. Most likely we will pursue some other classes in the fall due to uncertainty of regular classes.<br><br>Marija</span><span class="wp-more-toggle">read more</span></span></div>
